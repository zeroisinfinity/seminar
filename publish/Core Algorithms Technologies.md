  - Secure communication using public-key cryptography, TLS.

## 8. Human-in-the-Loop & Governance
- **Escalation Protocol Engines:**  
  - Automated workflows with human review checkpoints for critical decisions.
- **Rights & Consent Management:**  
  - Consent record tracking, user-configurable privacy controls.

## 9. Infrastructure & Scalability
